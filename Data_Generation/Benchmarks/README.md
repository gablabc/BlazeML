### Benchmarks

This contains the bash scripts used to generate the data necessary to generate benchmarks graphs and compare the new backend with the old one. This could also be extended to generate data with the OpenMP backend.

To generate a data set to analyse block-size, the script generate_data.sh must be changed and run.
